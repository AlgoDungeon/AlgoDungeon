	<h1>rot.js: native modules</h1>
	<p>This example includes rot.js using native ES2015 modules. You need a fairly modern web browser. This setup is suitable for development only, as it results in a large number of HTTP requests. The advantage is that you do not have to bundle/compile your code.</p>
	<p>If you see a small roguelike-like scene below, your browser supports native ES2015 modules.</p>
